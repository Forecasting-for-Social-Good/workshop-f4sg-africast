We assume you are broadly comfortable with R code, the RStudio environment and the tidyverse.\n  * This is not a statistics course. We assume you are familiar with concepts such as the mean, standard deviation, quantiles, regression, normal distribution, likelihood, etc.\n  * This is not a theory course. We are not going to derive anything. We will teach you time series and forecasting tools, when to use them, and how to use them most effectively.\n\n## Key reference\n\n\\large\n\n\\begin{block}{}\\bf\n\\hangafter=1\\hangindent=.3cm\n {Hyndman, R.~J. \\& Athanasopoulos, G.
